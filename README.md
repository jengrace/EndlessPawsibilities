Endless Pawsibilities
===============

Endless Pawsibilities provides a service for animal rescues to create their own webpage. It is intended to give animal rescues a way to gain more exposure to the public and have a modern system to accept donations through PayPal. Each animal rescue can manage their content on a private dashboard. Public users can then search the rescues available on my web app and check out what animals are available for adoption. Contact information of each rescue as well as information about the animals at their rescue are displayed for potential adopters.
